    <p>This is my first ever webpage. Building a HTML isn't as confusing as I thought it would be. Everything is broken down as you make the page. Starting with the headers and leading into the paragraph. The main struggle when creating the page is simply underestand the abreviations and meaning of what commands can cause certain actions. I learned alot from this content and assignment. To list a few would be understanding the difference between the header and paragraph. As well with know how to make words bold or slanted. A lot can be done to a webpage jsut takes knowing how to do it and doing the right steps.</p>
