    <p>This is my first ever webpage. Building a HTML isn't as confusing as I thought it would be. Everything is broken down as you make the page. Starting with the headers and leading into the paragraph. The main struggle when creating the page is simply underestand the abreviations and meaning of what commands can cause certain actions. I learned alot from this content and assignment. To list a few would be understanding the difference between the header and paragraph. As well with know how to make words bold or slanted. A lot can be done to a webpage jsut takes knowing how to do it and doing the right steps.</p>

    <li>To make ordered and un ordered lists.</li>

        <h2>Lab 03</h2>
        <p><i>Published on 19 Feb, 2025 by Daniel Kogan</i></p>
        <p>This week we learned about CSS. CSS is a style sheet layout that is used to create different fonts, background colors, add images, sections, and so much more. In this assignment I used 2 class selectors and 1 ID selector. One thing I would like to learn is how to fill in the empty spots that are in Lab 01 and Lab 03. Those are the only 2 that have that since I used a class selector. Another thing I wanted to learn was how to only cover certain words with a background color. My header has a background color going straight across but I only want it covering "Learning Web Standards". This assignment was at first confusing but after rewatching the class and being hands on I started to get a hang of it. Another thing that helped is the example of what our html should look like image that was posted after class on Feb 19, 2025. It gave me a sense of relief that my code matched up with what it was supposed to look like. As well helped me with mistakes I unfortunately did have from Lab 02.  </p>
